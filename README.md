Building a classification model (Random Forest classifier) for Penguin classification on Streamlit web app </br>
The application has following features:</br>
1. User can provide input to the classification model for prediction in 2 ways:</br>
a. By way of adjusting the sliding/selector bars present in the sidebar, which are basically features to the model</br>
b. By way of uploading files to the app via button "Browse files" under section - <ins>Drag & Drop file here</ins> </br>
2. Results of the classification model are displayed in the main page. </br>
a. Prediction class, which tells the class to which Penguin belongs is displayed along with prediction probability for each class.
3. The input features fed to the model (via either way) is also displayed in the tabular form in the main page
